# DesktopBuddy

DesktopBuddy brings your Windows desktop into Resonite as native-feeling world-space panels. It is built for people who want their real desktop, monitors, and application windows available inside a world without turning the experience into a flat screen overlay.

## Features

- Spawn full desktops, monitors, or individual application windows as grabbable curved panels.
- Interact with windows using VR controller, hand tracking, or touch input.
- Fully gpu accelerated WGC desktop capture.
- Stream panels to other users through local encoding and remote HTTPS tunnel support.
- Virtual video camera drivers for windows so you can do video calls from within resonite.
- Virtual microphone driver for windows so friends can hear you in calls in resonite.
- Use privacy controls for hiding or limiting what other users can see.
- Adjust capture, streaming, audio, culling, viewer, and debug options from the in-world settings panel.
- Keep game-side and renderer-side work separated through the shared texture bridge.
